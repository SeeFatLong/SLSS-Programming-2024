**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level 2 header

Name        | Age       | Coolness   | Superpower
---         | ---       | ---        | ---
Batman      | Probably 30| VERY      | RICH/Smart
Mr. Ubial   | Pretty old |His kids think he is cool| He can nap anywhere

To make a list we use the following

* This is the first item in the listr
* This is the second
    * This is actually a subpoint in this list

- This is also a list
- You can use these as bullets as well
    - You can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first item in an ordered list
2. This is the second
    1. This is a sublist
    2. Another item
        - This is unordered
        - Same here

# Blockquotes

These are usually used to show quotes, things people have said
